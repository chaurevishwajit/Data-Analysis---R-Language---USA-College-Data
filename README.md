Choosing a college requires balancing a number of goals and determining which are most important. Is it true that a good location is 
more important than a high graduation rate? Is it more important to have a distinguished name than to have life-changing new 
experiences? The "best" option is determined by a family's priorities. And there have never been so many instruments to find it out as 
there are now. Detailed statistics are now just a mouse click away for anyone looking to compare schools' educational achievements in 
terms of graduation rates, post-college incomes, or alumni debt loads. Information regarding the genuine costs of colleges, including 
financial help, is also plentiful. The United States is at the forefront of this data boom. Department of Education, which first released a 
draft of its College Scorecard in 2013 and has been fine-tuning the 7,700-institution database ever since. 
We're breaking down the dataset into 4 sections for our analysis. 
1. We will perform Visualization on the study of Incomes in the first section, where we will find the distribution of starting and midcareer salaries, as well as the relationship between them. 
2. In the second phase, we will visualize the various salaries by major and see which degrees exhibit the biggest income rise from 
entry to mid-career. 
3. In the third section, we will visualize the various salaries based on their college type. We must assess whether a student should 
attend a state-run party school. Then we need to figure out which colleges have the highest starting and mid-career wages, as well as 
the Top 20 institutions by type. 
4. In the final section, we do a salary study depending on various geographies. The next step is to determine the top 20 colleges by 
region.
